First question answer : SELECT COUNT(*) ,(SELECT AVG(length) FROM film)
                          FROM film
                          WHERE length > 
                          (
                          SELECT AVG(length) FROM film
                          )

Second question answer : SELECT COUNT(*), (SELECT MAX(rental_rate) FROM film)
                          FROM film
                          WHERE rental_rate =
                          (
                          SELECT MAX(rental_rate) FROM film
                          )

Third question answer : SELECT COUNT(*), (SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film), (SELECT MIN(rental_rate) FROM film)
                          FROM film
                          WHERE rental_rate = (SELECT MIN(rental_rate) FROM film) 
                          AND replacement_cost = (SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film)

Fourth question answer : SELECT COUNT(*) AS siparis, customer_id FROM payment 
                          GROUP BY customer_id
                          HAVING customer_id = ANY (SELECT customer_id FROM payment)
                          ORDER BY siparis DESC;
